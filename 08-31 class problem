Which scenario has the smaller t? From T=90 to T=65 OR T=85 to T=60?

Create an array for t
  t begins at 0, ends at ???

Scenario 1: T_i at 90

  
Scenario 2: T_i at 85

#### Problem steps
Define variables
  t = 0
  T_i = 90 OR 85
  T_env = (given)

Define function 
  ... [insert eq.]

Use function! Define T for each value of t (for both scenarios)
  T1 = function(t)
  T2 = function(t)

PLOT!
